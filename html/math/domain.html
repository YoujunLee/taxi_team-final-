<!--A predicate is a statement with one or more variables so that when the variable is replaced by a value from a specified domain, the resulting statement is unambiguously true or false.  In the following five exercises, you will be given predicates P() and randomly generated domains D.  In each case, give the set of those elements of the domain  for which P() is true.Truth values of predicatesP(x) is the predicate " > 5."  Give the set of those elements of the domain D for which P() is true.Let D = Answer:  {}CHECK#1P(x) is the predicate "( > 5) Ù (x £10)."  Give the set of those elements of the domain D for which P() is true.#2P(x) is the predicate "2 > "  Give the set of those elements of the domain D for which P() is true.#3P(x) is the predicate " is even."  Give the set of those elements of the domain D for which P() is true.#4P(x) is the predicate "( is even) Ú ( < 8)."  Give the set of those elements of the domain D for which P() is true.#5Summary.  In the five exercises of this activity, you were given predicates P() and randomly generated domains D, and you were to determine the set of those elements of the domain  for which P() is true.
