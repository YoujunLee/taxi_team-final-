<!--A predicate is a statement with one or more variables so that when the variable is replaced by a value from a specified domain, the resulting statement is unambiguously true or false.  In the following five exercises, you will be given predicates P() and randomly generated domains D.  In each case, give the set of those elements of the domain  for which the negation of is true.Truth value of the negation of a predicateP(x) is the predicate " > 4"  Give the set of those elements of the domain D for which the negation of P() is true.Let D = Answer:  {}CHECK#1Truth values of predicatesP(x) is the predicate "( > 4) ? ( 11)."  Give the set of those elements of the domain D for which the negation of P(true.#2P(x) is the predicate "2 +  > 10"  Give the set of those elements of the domain D for which the negation of P(is true.#3P(x) is the predicate " is even."  Give the set of those elements of the domain D for which the negation of P(is true.#4P(x) is the predicate "( is even) ? ( < 7)."  Give the set of those elements of the domain D for which the negation of P(is true.#5Summary.  In the five exercises of this activity, you were given predicates P() and randomly generated domains Dand you were to determine the set of those elements of the domain  for which the negation of ) is true.
